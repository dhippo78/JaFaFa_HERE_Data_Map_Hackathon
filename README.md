# JaFaFa_HERE_Data_Map_Hackathon
HERE Map Data Hackathon

JáFáFá uses HERE Location Services and HERE Navigation Services to implement a turn-by-turn navigation application that helps vehicle drivers in identifying petroleum filling stations along a route during a journey, whose products have been rated for quality (liquid density) and whose product dispensing machines have been been rated for accuracy (quantity dispensed vs quantity expected).

JáFáFá is currently adapted for only Lagos, Nigeria.
